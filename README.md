# Indian Stock Market Index Prediction Using LSTM, Linear Regression, and KNN

This project aims to predict Indian stock market indices using various machine learning models like **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, **Linear Regression**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. We leverage historical stock data to compare the effectiveness of different models in financial forecasting.

## Key Features
1. **Data Retrieval:** Using the `yfinance` API to download historical data.
2. **Models Implemented:**
   - **LSTM:** A recurrent neural network for sequential data.
   - **Linear Regression:** A statistical method for prediction.
   - **KNN:** A simple algorithm based on proximity to nearby points.
3. **Metrics Used:**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Accuracy Score
4. **Visualization:** Stock trends and model performance graphs using `matplotlib`.
